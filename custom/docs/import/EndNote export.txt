Intimate partner violence
Victimisation	Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the relationship between bullying and victimisation in school and exposure to interparental violence in a non-clinical sample of Italian youngsters. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 1059 Italian elementary and middle school students. Participants completed a self-report anonymous questionnaire measuring bullying and victimisation and exposure to interparental violence. The questionnaire also included measures on parental child abuse and socio-demographic variables. Results: Almost half of all boys and girls reported different types of bullying and victimisation in the previous 3 months, with boys more involved than girls in bullying others. Exposure to interparental physical violence and direct bullying were significantly associated especially for girls: girls exposed to father's violence against the mother and those exposed to mother's violence against the father were among the most likely to bully directly others compared with girls who had not been exposed to any interparental violence. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that bullying and victimisation were predicted by exposure to interparental violence, especially mother-to-father violence, over and above age, gender, and child abuse by the father. Conclusions: Exposure to interparental violence is associated with bullying and victimisation in school, even after controlling for direct child abuse. Violence within the family has detrimental effects on the child's behaviour; schools, in this regard, can play a fundamental role in early detection of maladjustment.				internal-pdf://Baldry 2003 - Bullying in schools-4183078913/Baldry 2003 - Bullying in schools.pdf

Young people who sexually abuse	Scores on the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were collected from two samples of incarcerated delinquent males: 74 adjudicated sexual abusers and 53 nonsexual abusers. In comparison to non-sexually abusive youths, a larger percentage of the sexually abusive youths indicated a history of childhood sexual victimisation. The scores were then entered into a logistic regression to assess the contribution of personality characteristics to a social learning "victim-to-victimiser" etiological model. After controlling for time in treatment, the model correctly classified 76.6% of the youths. The variables that contributed significantly to the social learning model were the CTQ Sexual Abuse and Physical Neglect scales and the Submissive and Forceful scales on the MACI. Research and treatment implications of these findings are discussed.				internal-pdf://Burton 2008 - An exploratory-1261379328/Burton 2008 - An exploratory.pdf

Young people who sexually abuse	This study compares sexually victimized and nonsexually victimized male adolescent sexual abusers on a number of variables. Self-report measures were administered to 325 male sexually abusive youth (average age 16) in six residential facilities in the Midwest, 55% of whom reported sexual victimization. The results indicate that the sexually victimized sexual abusers have more severe developmental antecedents (trauma, family characteristics, early exposure to pornography and personality) and recent behavioral difficulties (characteristics of sexual aggression, sexual arousal, use of pornography, and nonsexual criminal behavior) than the nonsexually victimized group. Results are contrasted with recent typological research, which found no relationship between sexual victimization and subtype membership. Treatment, research, and theoretical implications are discussed.

Mandatory reporting	Objectives: This article reviews research, policy and programming in Australia, Canada and the US on the child welfare response to EDV. Method: The review draws on searches of standard research databases, interviews with researchers and practitioners, and the authors’ own research. Results: Although EDV is underreported, across studies 7% to 23% of youths in general population surveys experienced EDV, 36–39% of youth in DV cases have witnessed the violence, and 45–46% of primary caregivers in child maltreatment investigations have experienced DV. Mandatory reporting can increase the number of cases that come to the attention of child welfare, but without resources for training and programming can lead to inappropriate reports, lack of referral for further assessment, and strains on the child welfare system. Improving the child welfare response to EDV can include collaboration between child welfare workers and DV advocates; increased training on screening for DV; new protocols on DV; and dedicated DV staffing within child welfare agencies. In recent years, policy and program attention to EDV has also been embedded within broader national efforts to protect children from violence and maltreatment. Differential response models that eschew investigation in favor of assessment and service delivery hold promise for families with DV. Conclusions: Empirical data are limited, but current research and practice experience suggest that child welfare agencies seeking to improve the response to EDV should collaborate with other disciplines involved with preventing and responding to DV, seek resources to support training and programming, consider methods that avoid stigmatizing parents, and build in a program evaluation component to increase knowledge about effective practice.			http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213412000269	internal-pdf://Cross et al 2012 - Child welfare-3225697280/Cross et al 2012 - Child welfare.pdf

Domestic violence	ABSTRACTObjective To examine violence exposure, violent behaviors, psychological trauma, and suicide risk in a community sample of dangerously violent adolescents by comparison with a matched community sample of nonviolent adolescents. Method Anonymous self-report questionnaires were administered in the 1992–1993 school year to students in grades 9 through 12, in six public high schools located in Ohio and Colorado (N = 3,735). From this sample, 484 adolescents (349 males, 135 females) who reported attacking someone with a knife or shooting at someone within the past year (i.e., dangerously violent adolescents) were drawn. Four hundred eighty-four controls were also selected and matched on gender, age in years, ethnicity, area of residence, and family structure. Results Dangerously violent adolescents reported higher levels of exposure to violence and victimization than did matched controls. Dangerously violent females were more likely to score in the clinical range of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, anger, and dissociation than were control females and violent males; they also had significantly higher levels of suicide potential. Conclusions Students who have been known to commit violent acts should be adequately assessed for violence exposure and symptoms of psychological trauma, with special attention given to the suicide potential of violent females.				internal-pdf://4245719958/Flannery2001Violence.pdf

We found that the sexually victimized group had more severe developmental antecedents (e.g., trauma and early exposure to pornography) and behavioral difficulties (sexual aggression, arousal, pornography use, and nonsexual offenses). The present study compares sexually victimized and nonsexually victimized adolescent sexual abusers with a group of nonsexually victimized delinquent youth. Findings included that delinquent youth had fewer behavioral and developmental problems than the comparison groups. In addition, sexually victimized sexual abusers had the highest mean scores on trauma and personality measures. Implications for research and treatment are offered.

Sexual violence	While developmental perspectives on sexual violence have gained much interest in recent years, few empirical studies have been conducted to better understand its origins. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining the onset of physical aggression and normative sexual behaviours in pre-schoolers. This study is based on a sample of at risk children (n = 100) recruited as part of the KD-BEAR project, an on-going longitudinal study conducted in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Semi-structured interviews were completed with the primary caregiver and the child. The structural model examined showed a significant and important latent correlation between physical aggression and sexual behaviours across models tested, after controlling for child and familial characteristics. Furthermore, findings showed that male pre-schoolers coming from low income families having been referred for assessment and/or treatment for an externalising spectrum disorder showed higher levels of both aggression and sexual behaviours. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of developmental models of sexual violence, and the secondary prevention of sexual violence at its earliest stages.				internal-pdf://fulltext-4074971393/fulltext.pdf

Social support	Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the protective effect of social support in the relationship between exposure to violence and psychopathology. Exposure to violence in the family and exposure to violence in the community were examined separately. Exposure to violence was further divided according to whether violence was experienced as a victim or as a witness. Internalising and externalising forms of psychopathology, as well as post-traumatic stress symptomatology were examined. Method: Participants consisted of 65 high-risk adolescents admitted consecutively to psychiatric inpatient units. Data were collected by means of individual interviews, self-report questionnaires, and hospital charts. Results: Social support emerged as a protective factor with respect to the maladaptive effects of family violence, experienced as either a victim or as a witness. In contrast, social support did not appear to buffer the maladaptive effects of community violence, regardless of whether violence was experienced as a victim or as a witness. In fact, the relationship between community violence and psychopathology was found to be generally non significant regardless of social support status. Conclusions: These findings suggest that exposure to family violence may affect development differently than exposure to community violence, allowing social support to effectively buffer the effects of family, but not community violence. This finding highlights the importance of examining violence exposure that occurs within the family separately from violence exposure that occurs within the community.				internal-pdf://Muller et al 2000 - Social support and the relationship-3333839105/Muller et al 2000 - Social support and the relationship.pdf

Young people who sexually abuse	The failure to account for differences between adolescent males who offend against children and those who offend against peers may account for the similarities found between sex-offending samples and non-sexual delinquents. Psychopathy traits (grandiosity, impulsivity, lack of empathy, interpersonally exploitative and risk-taking) and antisocial behaviour, including behaviours and age of onset for delinquent behaviours and drug use, were explored in male adolescents with sex offences against children, sex offences against peer/adults, sexual offences against both and non-sex delinquents. Youths who committed sexual offences were similar on psychopathic traits and level of antisocial behaviour. Higher levels of grandiosity and lack of empathy were found in those whose offences were non-sexual. Parental dysfunction was consistent across all groups, but maternal psychiatric difficulties were more frequent in youths with histories of sexual offending and a history of maternal substance abuse was more common for cross-over sexual offenders. These data indicate that most psychopathy traits and antisocial behaviour are similar in all sexual offenders, while maternal dysfunction and narcissistic traits distinguish them from non-sex delinquents.

Participants included 184 children, ages 7 to 13, and their mothers who were residing at battered women shelters. Compared to children who witnessed interparental violence, children who were both witnesses as well as victims of physical abuse scored significantly higher on externalising behavior problems. A stepwise logistical regression analysis identified numerous predictors of child abuse among maritally violent families. These included a greater frequency and severity of marital violence, less marital satisfaction, and a poorer quality of father-child relationship as perceived by the children. In addition, children from families where child abuse occurred were more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviour problems than children who only witnessed marital violence				internal-pdf://O'Keefe, Maura 1995 - Predictors of child abuse-2033281280/O'Keefe, Maura 1995 - Predictors of child abuse.pdf

Post-traumatic stress disorder
PTSD	Objective: A model was examined in which the association between a parent’s history of abuse and the parent’s own abusive behavior toward his or her children was hypothesized to be mediated by parental psychopathology, early childbearing, and consistency of discipline. Additionally, the effect of severity of abuse on the likelihood of becoming abusive was examined. Method: Participants were 109 parents (G1) and their male children (G2) who were involved in a longitudinal study. The G1 parents reported on their own experiences of abuse when they were children. Ten years later, the G2 youths reported on the G1 parents’ abusive behavior toward them. A number of other factors, including parental socioeconomic status (SES), antisocial behavior, depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), consistency of discipline, and the perceived early difficulty of the G2 children were measured. Results: As reported by their own children, parents who reported having been abused in childhood were significantly more likely to engage in abusive behaviors toward the next generation. Findings indicated that abuse experienced by the parents, as well as consistency of discipline and depression plus PTSD, were predictive of parental abuse of the child. Contrary to hypotheses, the effects were not fully mediated. However, there were significant interactions between parental history of abuse and consistency of discipline, as well as abuse history and depression and PTSD. Parents who had experienced multiple acts of abuse and at least one physical impact were more likely to become abusive than were the other parents. Conclusions: The implications of these findings for preventive interventions are discussed.				internal-pdf://Pears et al 2001 - Intergenerational transmission-3268342272/Pears et al 2001 - Intergenerational transmission.pdf

Exposure to violence
Child adjustment	Although the majority of families that experience intimate partner violence (IPV) have more than one child, most research to date has focused upon a single child within these families. A significant body of research has indicated siblings play an important role in children's adjustment and well-being. To address this gap, the three main goals of the present study were to compare the adjustment of older and younger siblings exposed to IPV, to describe and compare the quality of these sibling relationships from multiple perspectives, and to investigate how sibling adjustment and relationship quality influence children's adjustment. Forty-seven sibling pairs and their mothers were recruited from the community. Mothers self-reported on their violent experiences using the Conflict Tactics Scale, and also estimated the length of time their children were exposed to IPV. Mothers and children completed assessments of child adjustment and the quality of sibling relationships. Observers also assessed the quality of sibling interaction. Results indicated that adjustment between siblings was highly inter-related. On average, mothers reported sibling relationships as less positive but also as less hostile than did siblings themselves. Higher levels of sibling hostility, lower levels of sibling warmth and higher levels of disengagement each significantly predicted child adjustment; however, these effects were predicated upon the adjustment of the other sibling. The sibling relationships of children exposed to IPV made a difference in their individual adjustment, and their adjustment issues influenced how they feel about and interacted with their sibling. Sibling hostility played a stronger role in adjustment issues than sibling warmth. The nature of sibling influences and the direction of future research were discussed.				internal-pdf://3625182022/Piotrowski2014Siblings Exposed.pdf									Eng

Sexual development	Youth with confirmed histories of sexual abuse (N = 118) were followed longitudinally to examine associations between their initial sexual reactions to abuse and subsequent sexual functioning. Participants were interviewed at abuse discovery (ages 8 through 15) and again 1 and 6 years later. Eroticism and sexual anxiety emerged as distinct indices of abuse-specific sexual reactions and predicted subsequent sexual functioning. Eroticism was associated with indicators of heightened sexuality, including more sexual risk behavior and views of sexual intimacy focused on partners’ needs. Sexual anxiety was associated with indicators of diminished sexuality, including few sexual partners and avoidant views of sexual intimacy. Age at abuse discovery moderated some associations, suggesting that the timing of abuse-specific reactions affects trajectories of sexual development. Findings point to the need for a developmental approach to understanding how abuse-specific sexual reactions disrupt sexual development and the need for early interventions promoting healthy sexual development.

Socialisation	Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the distinct developmental experiences associated with child sexual abuse and rape. Method: For 269 sexual offenders (137 rapists and 132 child sexual abusers), developmental experiences were recorded from a behavioral checklist, a parental-bonding survey, and a sexual history questionnaire. Offender classification was obtained from official records and verified through polygraph examinations. Results: Compared to rapists, child sexual abusers reported more frequent experiences of child sexual abuse (73%), early exposure to pornography (65% before age 10), an earlier onset of masturbation (60% before age 11), and sexual activities with animals (38%). In contrast to child sexual abusers, rapists reported more frequent experiences of physical abuse (68%), parental violence (78%), emotional abuse (70%), and cruelty to animals (68%). Both child sexual abusers and rapists (>93%) reported frequent exposure to violent media during their childhood. Most offenders (94%) described having insecure parental attachment bonds; 76% of rapists reported avoidant parental attachments and 62% of child sexual abusers reported anxious parental attachments. Conclusions: Findings from this study support the role of specific developmental experiences as etiological factors in differential sexual offending. Child sexual abusers' developmental histories were characterised by heightened sexuality; whereas rapists' childhood histories were more indicative of violence. These findings have implications for the treatment of sexual abusers and the prevention of sexual abuse. Practice Implications: This study's findings suggest that sexual offenders have been socialised to satisfy human needs of intimacy and sexuality through maladaptive means, which implies that a risk management approach may not be sufficient treatment. Although risk models teach offenders skills to avoid high-risk situations, they fail to address the maladaptive strategies that they may have developed for satisfying needs. Instead, the focus of treatment should be to equip offenders with the knowledge, skills, and opportunities to achieve these needs in an acceptable manner. Thus, this model will provide these individuals with the opportunity to live a healthy life without sexual offending.			http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511118	internal-pdf://Simons et al 2008 - Developmental experiences-3780531968/Simons et al 2008 - Developmental experiences.pdf	Colorado Department of Corrections, Canon City, CO, USA.

Sexual aggression
Young people who sexually abuse	Theory and previous studies have suggested that sexual aggression in juveniles is associated with past sexual victimization, deficits in social competence, and high levels of neurotic symptoms. This study examined these and other variables as potential correlates of sexual aggression in a sample of 210 chronic delinquents that included 24 arrested sex offenders, 26 self-reported sexual offenders, 106 nonsexual violent offenders, and 54 low-violence controls. Arrested and self-reported sex offenders differed only with respect to sexual victimization, with arrested offenders being more likely to report victimization by a male perpetrator. The combined sex offender group differed from the low-violence control group on several variables; the former reported greater exposure to serious physical abuse and to domestic violence involving weapons, attitudes more accepting of sexual and physical aggression, and more use of aggressive control seeking in response to stress. Implications of these findings for rehabilitation and treatment programs are discussed.				internal-pdf://2020454295/Spaccarelli1997Psychosocial.pdf

Sexualised behaviours	Exploratory analyses of sexual behaviour problems (SBP) were conducted within a larger epidemiological study of 347 preadolescent children in foster and kinship care. SBP was estimated from caregiver-reported scores on the Assessment Checklist for Children. The study simultaneously examined a large number of discrete and cumulative influences on the development of children at high risk for SBP. Most children with SBP had corresponding psychopathology, most notably conduct problems, inattention, and interpersonal behaviour problems suggestive of attachment disturbances. Several correlates identified in previous studies were not associated with SBP. High concordance of SBP was found among 52 sibling dyads. Independent predictors of SBP were older age at entry into care, female gender, placement instability, and contact sexual abuse. The findings emphasize the significance of cumulative risk among children exposed to multiple adversities. The findings generated several hypothesised mechanisms involving attachment disturbances.

Being protective is considered natural and instinctive (Bowlby 1971, as cited in Corby 1993), and most children are well cared for by their parents. However, there are some children for whom a parent's 'instinctive' desire to protect is unrealised and children are thereby exposed to the risk of child maltreatment.			http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/pubs/issues/issues6/issues6.html	internal-pdf://Tomison 1996 - Intergenerational transmission-2576482816/Tomison 1996 - Intergenerational transmission.pdf

Domestic violence	There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that different types of violence may occur simultaneously in the same family, and that the presence of one form of violence may be a strong predictor of the other. Yet until recently, policy, research and practice dealing with family violence has been fragmented, with the various types of violence that may occur between family members usually managed independently of one another. In this paper the relationship between child maltreatment and domestic violence is explored, in particular, the relationship between child sexual abuse and domestic violence, and the ‘forgotten’ victims of family violence - children who witness domestic violence. It is contended that to adequately prevent family violence requires a shift in policy and practice to ensure that the ‘totality of violence’ present in families is addressed. Specifically recommended are greater cross-sectoral acknowledgment of the various forms of family violence, and the development of an overarching National Framework and a National Roundtable of Violence Prevention, encompassing the prevention of all violence.				internal-pdf://Tomison 2000 - Exploring family violence-1370877696/Tomison 2000 - Exploring family violence.pdf
